IMPORTANT:

Project Report is named as "ProjectReport.pdf"

Before execution of extract_restaurant_reviews.py or running the commands in "Sentiment Analysis and Word Frequency.ipynb", you should delete "frequency_list" file to get fresh list since otherwise it will keep appending everytime you run. Please note that it wont affect the plots even if you dont delete it since we arent using frequency_list file anywhere but for our own easy-to-visualize purposes.

iPythonExamples.pdf contains all the commands used to generate many plots (few of which were used in report) in our experimental studies.

For any concerns regarding code or report, please email me at s1672896@sms.ed.ac.uk
